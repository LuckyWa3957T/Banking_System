# Banking_System
This project is a console-based Banking System developed using Java and MySQL. It allows users to create a bank account, log in securely, and perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. The system uses JDBC to connect Java with the MySQL database, ensuring that user data is stored permanently.
